Purpose: 
-------

This module gives an example of how opencv function "imread" can be called using python(import cv2) which is in turn called by scilab function "cv_imageopen()"

Future:
-------

This Module can be extended to provide facility to users to call various OpenCV functions that could help them in Processing their Images Supporting Computer Vision


Requirements:
-------

User needs :->
1) Scilab Installed and running
2) PIMS installed in Scilab (atomsInstall("PIMS"))
3) Python 2.7 installed
4) Configured OpenCV with Python ( apt-get install python-opencv)
